    <h1>What is "Detailing"?</h1>
    
    <p>
      Detailing is truly an art that a detailer must have a craving passion for, 
      in order for them to be the best possible. This is why it is extremely important 
      to find a detailer that you know is informed and reliable. Detailing consists 
      of the deep cleaning, decontamination from any films or embeded particles,
      and the protection of the vehicle as well as dressing to make the car look
      more appealing and clean.

      For most vehicles, there are 2 main areas that a person may be looking to 
      get detailed which would be the Exterior and the Interior. Typically, you
      will find services for the exterior such as cleaning the paint as well as 
      the wheels and tires. Paint decontamination is one of the most important 
      steps in an exterior detail, because it prepares the vehicle for the next 
      step which is protection. Typically, you will find 2 types of protection 
      when getting your car detailed which are sealants (formerly known as waxes)
      and coatings. Sealants are more of a shorter term protection for the paint 
      whereas coatings provide a longer protection window, but are typically more 
      costly. As far as the interior goes, there are specific things that you should 
      look for when getting your interior detailed, however there are a few extra
      services that are available if you desire. The most common and important 
      extra service that is typically available is carpet and upholsterly 
      extraction. This is used for more deep cleans, however it can be quite 
      costly.

      However, the most important aspect of getting your car detailed is who is 
      detailing your car. Every detailer does things a little different and offer
      different services with different packages, so it is extremely important to
      have an open conversation with anyone before they detail your car about 
      what they are providing and the results that you should expect. At the end 
      of your reading on this website, you should be able to be informed of the 
      most typical services that are available at many local detailing shops, 
      and know what those services will actually do for you and your vehicle.
