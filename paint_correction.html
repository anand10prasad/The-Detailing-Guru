  <h1>Paint Correction</h1>
  
  <p>
    Paint correction is the act of using mainly a machine polisher along with 
    a multitude of different pads and polishes/compounds to slowly remove any
    scratches or swirls in the paint. These scratches and swirls are usually easier
    to see when the paint is in direct sunlight. Sometimes, a scratch is too deep
    for a machine polisher to remove, so detailers may differ to wet sanding followed
    by a machine compound and polish. There are different levels of paint correction
    such as a paint enhancement, a 1-Step Polish, a 2-Step Polish, and wet sanding.
    However, each correction typically costs different prices, and some can take 
    up to double, even triple the time to complete the entire correction. It is 
    also important to look into a detailers results in order to see if what they 
    are able to produce will match what you as the customer are expecting.
  </p>

  <h2>Paint Enhancement</h2>
  
  <p>
    The goal of a paint enhancement is to remove the top layer of clear coat that
    is faded from sun damage, in order to create a "glossy" effect on the paint. 
    Typically a person can expext from 5-10% of scratch removal. When getting a
    paint enhancement, you should not be expecting a massive difference from what
    the previous state of the paint is. A detailers goal in performing a paint 
    enhancement is to not remove scratches, but brighten up the car by removing old
    and faded layers of clear coat. Typically, this service is the least expensive 
    paint correction that is available, but often reguarded to as the most cost
    effective option.

    Like all services, but paint corrections in specific, it is important to talk
    with your detailer and see what is possible to achieve on your vehicle as well
    as set the bar for any expectations you should have with the finished result.
    Lastly, just like any paint correction or detail for that matter, it is important 
    to protect the paint after you are done correcting it. This will help preserve 
    the current finish and shine of the clear coat, as well as protect from micro-scratches
    that are put in clear coat from everyday use.
  </p>
  
  <br>
  
  <h2>1-Step Paint Correction</h2>
  
  <p>
    A 1-Step paint correction is when a detailer uses one pad and one polish or 
    compound to remove as many scratches in the paint as possible, without switching
    pad or polish/compound. The goal of a 1-Step paint correction is to remove as
    many scratches from the clear coat, while still being relatively cost-effective.
    Customers looking to get a 1-Step paint correction can typically expect anywhere
    from 30-70% of scratch removal.
    
  </p>

  <p>
    As with any detailing service, it is even more important to talk to your detailer
    about what your expectations should be with the finshed correction. When you 
    start to get deeper and deeper into correcting (chasing perfection), a detailer
    may notice some things that are too deep into the clear or even past the clear 
    coat into the lower paint levels, that is not possible to remove. Likewise, 
    with a 1-Step paint correction you may not get a lot of the deeper scratches
    that you would be able to get with a 2-Step or wet-sanding, however the detailer
    will be able to get a noticable amount of swirls and light scrathes out of the 
    clear coat. Finally as for any detailing service it is recommended to put some 
    type of protection on the paint, so talk to your detailer beforehand to see the 
    coating and sealant options that are available to you.
    
  </p>

  <h2>2-Step Paint Correction +</h2>
  
  <p>
    A 2-Step paint correction is when a detailer uses typically 2 different pads, 
    one compound, and one polish to achieve maximum scratch removal without wet-sanding 
    the paint. The detailer will first start with a more aggressive "cutting" pad
    and a compound (which is more aggressive than a polish), to remove the majority 
    of scratches in the clear coat. However, since the 1st step of compounding the 
    clear coat is so aggressive, it leaves behind a "haze" or micro-marring after
    removing the deep scratches. In order to remove the so called "haze", the detailer
    must remove the compound from the paint, and change pads to a softer polishing pad.
    They will then use the soft polishing pad along side a polish to remove the 
    micro-marring that was induced from the compounding stage. The polish is used 
    to achieve a mirror-like finish. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Compounding and polishing a car or any vehicle for that matter, will remove 
    more clear coat than just an enhancement or a 1-Step correction. So it is even
    more crucial that you protect the paint after it has had a 2-Step correction
    done. Typically if you get a 2-Step paint correction, it is highly reccomended 
    that you get a professional paint coating applied immediately after the correction
    is done. This is to ensure that no scratches or micro-marring is instilled on 
    the paint for as long as possible after the correction is done. This will extend
    the life of the final finish of the paint. Typically a 2-Step paint correction
    will remove anywhere from 75-90% of all imperfections in the paint. This service 
    is also typically the most expensive correction you will get before you get 
    into wet-sanding spots. Althought it is one of the most expensive services that
    many detailing shops offer, the detailers goal is to make the paint as perfect 
    as possible which will show in the results. However it is still important to 
    talk to your detailer about what to expect on your vehicle as every vehicle 
    is different.
