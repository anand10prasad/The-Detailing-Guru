    <h1>Exterior Detailing</h1>
    
    <p>
      Exterior detailing consists of a few steps and they are as follows.
      Wheels and Tires first in order to ensure dirt from the wheels dont get on 
      freshly cleaned paint. Next is to work on door jams/engine bay. You may also 
      decide to clean out the gas fill up door. Next is to wash and decontaminate
      the paint and glass. The next step is optional, However it is important to 
      consider getting a paint correction. Finally, you will want to apply a protection
      ontop of your paint for ease of maintanance and minor scratch resistance. For 
      paint corrected cars, it is highly recommended that you consider applying a
      paint coating rather than the more traditional sealant.

      Exterior detailing is often the part that is more sought after as it requires
      more products and tools to achieve a desired level of cleanliness. For instance
      you must use a variation of products such as a pH-neutral soap. What a pH-neutral 
      soap does is ensure there are not any minerals in the soap that might dry on 
      the surface of the paint. A pressure washer is also highly reccomended when 
      detailing the exterior as it is used before a contact wash to remove any caked
      on or heavier dirt. Another important factor to look into is the products that
      your detailer is using. A quality wheel and tire cleaner as well as an All-Purpose
      Cleaner (APC), a multitude of brushes, wash-mits, and other cleaners are essential
      to any detailers equipment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It is important to talk to your local detaler about the chemicals and tools 
      that they use as well as their methods. For instance using the 2 bucket method
      when washing a car is essential to the preservation of the current state of 
      the clear coat. Detailers will also need a varriety of chemicals to clean
      the wheels and other crevices, however it is important to make sure no acid 
      based wheel cleaners are used on any raw metals as they can damage its finish.
      Ensure your detailer is taking all precautions to provide your vehicle with 
      the upmost care possible.
